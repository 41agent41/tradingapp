# 🚀 TradingApp Remote Server Deployment Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed: IB Service Docker Build Error

**Problem Resolved:** The deployment was failing with `ERROR: No matching distribution found for ib_insync==0.20.0`

**Root Cause:** The `ib_insync` package version `0.20.0` doesn't exist. The correct version naming follows `0.9.x` pattern.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed `ib_service/requirements.txt`: Changed `ib_insync==0.20.0` → `ib_insync==0.9.86`
- ✅ Consolidated all deployment scripts into single `deploy-tradingapp.sh`
- ✅ Removed 6 separate script files for cleaner repository structure

## 🎯 Single Command Deployment

All deployment functionality is now consolidated into **one script**: `deploy-tradingapp.sh`

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# First time setup (installs Docker)
./deploy-tradingapp.sh install

# Deploy the full application
./deploy-tradingapp.sh deploy

# Rebuild with enhanced IB service features
./deploy-tradingapp.sh ib-rebuild

# Check status
./deploy-tradingapp.sh status

# Test all connections
./deploy-tradingapp.sh test
```

---

## 📋 Complete Remote Server Deployment Process

### 1. Server Preparation

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install git if not present
sudo apt install -y git curl

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tradingapp.git
cd tradingapp
```

### 2. One-Command Installation & Deployment

```bash
# Install Docker and dependencies (first time only)
./deploy-tradingapp.sh install

# If prompted to log out/restart after Docker install:
exit  # Then log back in and continue

# Deploy the complete application
./deploy-tradingapp.sh deploy
```

### 3. Verification & Testing

```bash
# Check all services are running
./deploy-tradingapp.sh status

# Test all API endpoints
./deploy-tradingapp.sh test

# View real-time logs
./deploy-tradingapp.sh logs
```

## 🔧 Available Commands

| Command | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `install` | Install Docker & dependencies | First time server setup |
| `deploy` | Full application deployment | Initial deployment |
| `rebuild` | Rebuild all services | Major updates |
| `ib-rebuild` | Rebuild IB service only | IB-specific fixes |
| `status` | Check service health | Monitoring |
| `test` | Test all connections | Troubleshooting |
| `logs` | Show service logs | Debugging |
| `stop` | Stop all services | Maintenance |
| `restart` | Restart services | Quick restart |
| `clean` | Remove containers/images | Reset environment |
| `env-setup` | Setup environment file | Configuration |

## 🌐 Service Access URLs

After successful deployment:

```
Frontend (TradingView Charts): http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000
Backend API:                   http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:4000  
IB Service:                    http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000
```

**Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your actual server IP address.**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Docker Build Fails**
```bash
# Clean rebuild everything
./deploy-tradingapp.sh clean
./deploy-tradingapp.sh rebuild
```

**2. IB Service Not Responding**
```bash
# Rebuild with enhanced features
./deploy-tradingapp.sh ib-rebuild
```

**3. Check Specific Service Logs**
```bash
# View detailed logs
./deploy-tradingapp.sh logs

# Or check specific service
docker compose logs ib_service
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
```

**4. Connection Issues**
```bash
# Test all endpoints
./deploy-tradingapp.sh test

# Check service status
./deploy-tradingapp.sh status
```

### Environment Configuration

The script automatically creates `.env` file with your server's IP:

```bash
# View current configuration
cat .env

# Manually setup environment if needed
./deploy-tradingapp.sh env-setup
```
